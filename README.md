# RickRoll
A simple application to prank your friend by throwing him this executable file

This app uses ASCII graphics to render Rick Astley's "Never Gonna Give You Up" clip. Also, when you start the application, the same music starts playing.

You can change the characters used to draw the clip, just change the value of one variable in the code:

At the moment, the program weighs quite a lot, because it stores a large archive in itself. This archive contains images with clip frames, on the basis of which ASCII graphics are rendered. It is planned to fix this in the future. For the same reason, the program takes time to run, since it needs to get files from this archive.
